# Makeup & Skincare Mood Board – Design Project

A creative design project focused on developing visual direction and brand identity concepts for beauty-related platforms, specifically makeup and skincare.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project consists of two digital mood boards created to explore and define visual aesthetics for:

- A **makeup brand concept**
- A **skincare brand concept**

The mood boards were designed to capture the emotional tone, color palette, typography, and overall visual style that could be used in future website or mobile app designs.

## 🎨 Makeup Mood Board

The makeup mood board focuses on bold, confident, and luxurious visual themes. It explores rich color palettes, high-contrast imagery, modern typography, and expressive beauty photography to communicate glamour and empowerment.
